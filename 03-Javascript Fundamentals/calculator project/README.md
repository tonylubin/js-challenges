****CALCULATOR PROJECT****

My first project building a fully working calculator using Javascript.

Based on a neomorphic design in white written with HTML, Javascript and SCSS (without using the eval() function!)

Functions:

--  divide(/)  multiplication (*) addition(+) subtraction(-)

--  a clear/reset(AC) button(function)

--  a delete(DEL) button that removes last button pressed on calculator from output screen

--  a working percentage(%) function

--  works with decimal(.) points
