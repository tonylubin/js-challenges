****JAVASCRIPT GAME PROJECT****

****Spin a Fortune****

As part of my software development course at Nology we were instructed to build a Javascript browser based game.  

This is one of my very first projects ,implementing what we have learnt on the course thus far, using functions, arrays, classes and objects.

I have adopted a Mobile-first based design process with responsiveness across mobile, tablet and laptop devices. It is written
with SCSS and implemented with the BEM convention. 

The game is a 2 player game that is a take on the classic tv game show "Wheel of Fortune". 

Includes:

--  restart button, without having to refresh the page

--  onscreen keyboard that toggles on/off

--  a spinning wheel that stops at random points on the wheel and alerts to the amount it stopped at

--  built using Flexbox and Grid

--  used Notie.js plugin to change appearance of alert box
